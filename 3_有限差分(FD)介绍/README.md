# 有限差分介绍

本单元将介绍用有限差分法求解均匀介质一维声学波动方程。

## Lecture 3: Introduction to Finite-Differences

### [Lesson 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Theory-of-seismic-waves-II/tree/master/03_Intro_finite_differences/1_fd_intro.ipynb): Finite Difference Approximations

We discuss different finite difference approximations of first and second derivatives of the Gaussian function and their accuracy.

### [Lesson 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Theory-of-seismic-waves-II/tree/master/03_Intro_finite_differences/2_fd_ac1d.ipynb): Solving the 1D acoustic wave equation by finite-differences

We model wave propagation in a 1D homogeneous acoustic medium by solving the corresponding wave equation using a 3-point spatial FD operator and an explicit time marching scheme. The modelling result is compared with 
an analytical solution.
